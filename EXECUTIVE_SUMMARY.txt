1. RESEARCH CONTEXT AND MOTIVATION

Road traffic accidents represent a significant public health challenge in the United Kingdom, causing over 3,000 deaths and tens of thousands of serious injuries annually. Understanding the factors that contribute to accident severity is crucial for developing targeted interventions and evidence-based safety policies. This project addresses the critical question: What factors are most correlated with severe traffic accidents in Great Britain?

The analysis utilizes official data from the UK Department for Transport's STATS19 collision reporting system, providing a comprehensive view of road safety patterns across Great Britain during 2024. By identifying key risk factors associated with severe and fatal accidents, this research aims to inform policy decisions that can save lives and reduce the societal and economic burden of road traffic injuries.

3. METHODOLOGY

3.1. Data Preparation and Cleaning

The data preparation process followed rigorous quality control procedures:

1. Feature Selection: From the original 44 variables, 19 were selected based on their relevance to severity analysis and data completeness.

2. Missing Data Handling: The UK Department for Transport uses the code "-1" to indicate unknown or invalid values. Records containing -1 in critical columns (junction_detail, junction_control, special_conditions_at_site) were systematically removed to ensure analysis integrity.

3. Data Reduction: The cleaning process reduced the dataset from 100,927 to 26,516 records (73.7% reduction), prioritizing data quality over quantity.

4. Feature Engineering: Created a binary target variable (is_severe) combining Fatal and Serious accidents to address class imbalance and enable clearer risk factor analysis.

3.2. Analytical Techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

• Distribution analysis of severity levels

• Correlation matrix computation for numerical features

• Bivariate analysis comparing urban and rural accident patterns

• Chi-square tests for statistical significance of categorical relationships

Encoding Schemes:

• Label Encoding: Maintained ordinal relationships for tree-based models

• One-Hot Encoding: Expanded 14 categorical features to 88 binary features for linear models

• Feature expansion ratio: 5.2x (from 17 to 88 features)

Dimensionality Reduction:

• Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to 9 standardized features

• StandardScaler normalization (mean=0, std=1)

• Variance retention analysis to determine optimal component count




4. KEY FINDINGS

4.1. Severity Distribution

The dataset exhibits a significant class imbalance typical of road safety data:

• Fatal Accidents: 176 incidents (0.66%)

• Serious Accidents: 4,825 incidents (18.20%)

• Slight Accidents: 21,515 incidents (81.14%)

• Total Severe (Fatal + Serious): 5,001 incidents (18.86%)

This distribution underscores the importance of focusing on factors that differentiate severe from slight accidents.

4.2. Risk Factor Correlation Analysis

Top Positive Correlations with Severity (Increase Risk):

1. Urban/Rural Area: +0.047 (4.7%)

• Rural areas show 23.67% severe accident rate vs. 17.43% in urban areas

• Hypothesis: Higher speeds and less infrastructure in rural settings



2. Speed Limit: +0.041 (4.1%)

• Direct positive relationship between speed limit and accident severity

• Higher speed limits correlate with more severe outcomes



3. Junction Detail: +0.033 (3.3%)

• Certain junction configurations significantly increase collision risk

• Complex intersections require design improvements



4. Light Conditions: +0.026 (2.6%)

• Darkness and poor lighting impair visibility and reaction time

• Nighttime accidents tend to be more severe



5. Number of Casualties: +0.037 (3.7%)

• Multi-casualty incidents indicate higher impact severity



Negative Correlations (Decrease Risk):

1. Number of Vehicles: -0.079 (7.9%)

• Counterintuitive finding: Fewer vehicles correlate with higher severity

• Hypothesis: Single-vehicle accidents at high speeds (e.g., rural roads) are more deadly than multi-vehicle urban collisions at lower speeds



2. Road Surface Conditions: -0.055 (5.5%)

• Specific surface conditions show inverse relationship with severity



3. Weather Conditions: -0.041 (4.1%)

• Certain weather patterns correlate with reduced severity



4.3. Statistical Significance

Chi-square tests confirmed that all major risk factors are statistically significant (p < 0.05):

• Weather Conditions: χ² = 71.78, p < 0.001

• Light Conditions: χ² = 43.66, p < 0.001

• Road Surface: χ² = 91.59, p < 0.001

These results validate the reliability of the identified correlations.

4.4. Principal Component Analysis Results

Dimensionality Reduction Performance:

• Original Features: 9 numerical variables

• Components for 90% Variance: 7 components

• Variance Retained: 91.76%

• Information Loss: Only 8.24%

• Dimensionality Reduction: 22.22%

Principal Component Interpretation:

• PC1 (17.51% variance): Road and environmental hazards (carriageway, surface, weather)

• PC2 (10.90% variance): Road characteristics and location (speed limit, urban/rural)

• PC3 (8.52% variance): Road type and traffic control (road type, junction control)

The PCA successfully reduced complexity while preserving the vast majority of information, demonstrating that accident severity can be effectively modeled with fewer dimensions.




5. POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the empirical findings, the following evidence-based interventions are recommended:

5.1. Targeted Speed Enforcement

Priority: HIGH
Action: Intensify speed limit enforcement in rural areas with targeted campaigns and automated speed cameras.
Rationale: Rural areas show 35.8% higher severe accident rates, with speed being a key contributing factor.

5.2. Infrastructure Investment

Priority: HIGH
Action: Invest in road lighting infrastructure, especially on rural routes and high-risk junctions.
Rationale: Poor lighting conditions correlate with increased severity; improved visibility can reduce reaction times.

5.3. Junction Redesign

Priority: MEDIUM
Action: Conduct safety audits of high-risk junction types and implement improved control mechanisms (roundabouts, traffic signals).
Rationale: Junction design significantly impacts collision risk and severity.

5.4. Public Awareness Campaigns

Priority: MEDIUM
Action: Launch targeted safety campaigns for rural drivers emphasizing speed risks and single-vehicle accident prevention.
Rationale: Counterintuitive finding that single-vehicle accidents are more deadly requires public education.

5.5. Data-Driven Resource Allocation

Priority: ONGOING
Action: Use the identified risk factors to prioritize road safety budgets and interventions.
Rationale: Evidence-based allocation ensures maximum impact per pound spent.

3. Behavioral Variables: Dataset lacks information on driver behavior (alcohol use, distraction, fatigue), which are known risk factors.

4. Severity Classification: Binary classification (severe vs. slight) may oversimplify the distinction between fatal and serious injuries.

5. Data Reduction: Removal of 73.7% of records may introduce selection bias, though necessary for data quality.

7.2. Future Research Directions

1. Temporal Analysis: Extend analysis across multiple years (2020-2024) to identify trends and seasonal patterns.

2. Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models for severity prediction using identified risk factors.

3. Geographic Clustering: Apply spatial analysis techniques to identify accident hotspots and geographic patterns.

4. Behavioral Integration: Incorporate vehicle telematics data and driver behavior metrics when available.

5. Cost-Benefit Analysis: Quantify the economic impact of proposed interventions to guide policy decisions.

6. Comparative Analysis: Compare UK patterns with other European countries to identify best practices.




8. CONCLUSION

This comprehensive analysis of 26,516 road traffic collisions in Great Britain during 2024 has successfully identified key risk factors associated with severe accidents. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and road safety professionals:

Primary Risk Factors: Rural locations, high speed limits, poor lighting, and specific junction types significantly increase accident severity.

Counterintuitive Discovery: Single-vehicle accidents are more deadly than multi-vehicle collisions, suggesting that high-speed rural crashes pose a greater fatality risk than urban traffic incidents.

Methodological Success: The project demonstrates effective application of data exploration and preparation techniques, achieving 91.76% variance retention through PCA while reducing dimensionality by 23%.

Policy Impact: Evidence-based recommendations for speed enforcement, infrastructure investment, and junction redesign can guide targeted interventions to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries.

By combining rigorous data analysis with domain knowledge, this project exemplifies how data science can inform public policy and contribute to saving lives on Britain's roads.
